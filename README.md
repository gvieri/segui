SEGUI (SEmantic GUI) 

This project is aimed to automatically translate simple concepts by using symbols. 

So we have a "3D" space of cultures, concepts, elements (symbols). 

These things are represented by sql tables.

There is another table named "message" that contains the users's messages. 
SEGUI is aimed to georeferenced messages so the the users must specify both preferred culture, and geographic position. 
Now they can query for recent messages related to the given/chosen position.
